Our goal is to provide you with the tools you need to maximize your profit, while securing your digital creations. Supported Programming Languages & Platforms \u00b6 Our list of supported programming languages and platforms are constantly changing as we evolve. Making our client libraries takes time, which is why we are slowly rolling out new libraries to support new languages and platforms. Click here to view our currently supported programming languages & programming languages. Features \u00b6 NuAuth was designed to make your digital creations as secure as possile, while retaining the native speed of your program. We offer many options for developers, that will broaden your ability to secure your software. We provide licensing, security, and remote information storage. Here's some of the features that we offer. Software Licensing \u00b6 In your application dashboard, you can find licensing options that allow you to generate, view, ban, and delete licenses. Licenses are used for authenticating users when your application is launched. You may ask the user for their license or handle the license any way you choose, but if the licensing system is enabled, they must have a valid license linked to their machine in order to use your software. Hardware Identification \u00b6 With hardware identification, you have the ability to limit the amount of machines that a license can be used on, essentially removing the possibility of having a user share their license. Network Identification \u00b6 With network identification, it acts similar to hardware identification but limits the amount of allowed IP addresses that a license can be used on instead. This feature is disabled by default, as most end-users do tend to have dynamic IP addresses which may lock the user out if their IP address happens to change. Application Integrity \u00b6 Application integrity ensures that no one can tamper with your software on their end. When this option is enabled, it checks the MD5 hash of your program against a stored hash in our database to ensure that the executable has not been modified in any way before executing. Version Checking / Blocking Outdated Versions \u00b6 Version checking ensures that outdated versions of your software cannot authenticate, basically locking the end user out until they update your software. Advanced Security Options \u00b6 We provide many different types of advanced security options that are available for certain applications depending on the programming language and environment. Debug Prevention \u00b6 Debugging Prevention prevents debuggers from attaching to your executable or hooking methods while the process is running. Injection Prevention \u00b6 Injection prevention prevents modules or dynamic libraries from being injected or manually mapped onto your executable during runtime. Dump Prevention \u00b6 Dump prevention prevents application and memory dumps of your executable during runtime. Timing Attack Prevention \u00b6 Timing attack prevention, also known as anti-sandbox, prevents your executable from being executed inside of a sandbox environment. Virtualization Prevention \u00b6 Virtualization prevention prevents your executable from being ran inside of a virtual / emulated machine. Analysis Prevention \u00b6 Analysis prevention prevents your executable from being analyzed with various known debuggers and disassemblers. Developer Ease-of-Use \u00b6 We provide a feature called \"Developer Mode\" which whitelists a specified IP address and hardware ID from certain essential security options such as integrity checks, debug prevention, and analysis prevention. This option can be enabled to allow developers of your application to test and debug your program without the DRM getting in the way of the development process.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started-with-nuauth","text":"","title":"Getting Started with NuAuth"},{"location":"getting-started/#overview","text":"NuAuth DRM Solutions provides cutting-edge DRM technology for small-time developers all the way to professional studios.
